## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
This is a shopping list. You can use voice commands to add products. It is designed, by now, to use it in Spanish.
It uses <a href="http://api.ai">api.ai</a> to analize voice and parse commands.

## <a name="howtouseit"></a>How to use it
* To open de project, do a 'pod install' and then open 
     Code/ApiAIDemoWatchOSSwift/ApiAIDemoWatchOSSwift.xcworkspace

* It can be used with text input or voice
* To use text input, just write something like "Pan" or "Leche".
* To use voice, tap the button in the center, and speak the name of a product "Pan" or "Huevo".
  
  Note: Commands are for the moment just supported in Spanish.
  
* The shopping list appears on the second tab
* If you want a product to be checked, slide to the right
* If you want a product to be deleted, slide to the left
